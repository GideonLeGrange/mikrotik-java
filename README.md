# mikrotik-java

A Java client library implementation for the Mikrotik RouterOS API. 

This project provides a Java client to manipulate Mikrotik routers using the remote API. Simple things must be easy to do, and complex things must be possible.

## Versions

This library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

**The current stable version is 2.1**

### Changes in version 2.1:

Version 2.1 adds the ability to use connection and command timeouts as requested by users. To see how to use these, please refer to the examples below. For more information, look at issue [#16](https://github.com/GideonLeGrange/mikrotik-java/issues/16). 

#### Previous 2.0 versions:

* 2.0.3 Fixed bug #18 - An empty username in ```login()``` caused the API to hang. 
* 2.0.2 Fixed bug #13 - processor thread wasn't being stopped on disconnect(), causing non-exit of application in some cases. 
* 2.0.1 fixed parsing of !=, < and > operators in a where clause. 
* 2.0.0 changed ResultListener to receive errors and completion notifications. This version is not backwards compatible with version 1.x. 

The last version 1.x release was 1.1.6 which was the first version to be pushed to Maven Central. Version 1 is considered *deprecated* and will no longer be supported or patched. 

#### Previous 1.1 versions:

* 1.1.5 fixed even more comamnd line parsing bugs.
* 1.1.4 fixed command line parsing bugs #7 and #8.
* 1.1.3 fixed severe command line parsing bugs, #3, #4 and #5.
* 1.1.2 added support for handling multi-line results, like for example /file print. 
* 1.1 added TLS (SSL) support to encrypt API traffic. 

## Getting the API

I recommend using the Maven artifact from Maven Central using this dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>me.legrange</groupId>
  <artifactId>mikrotik</artifactId>
  <version>2.1</version>
</dependency>
```
You can also clone or fork the repository, or download the source as a zip or tar.gz from [Releases](https://github.com/GideonLeGrange/mikrotik-java/releases)

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, be it bug fixes or other improvements. If you fix or change something, please submit a pull request. If you want to report a bug, please open an issue. 

# Examples

These examples should illustrate how to use this library. Please note that I assume that the user is proficient in Java and understands the Mikrotik command line syntax.

## Opening a connection
Here is a simple example: Connect to a router and reboot it. 

```java
ApiConnection con = ApiConnection.connect("10.0.1.1"); // connect to router
con.login("admin","password"); // log in to router
con.execute("/system/reboot"); // execute a command
con.disconnect(); // disconnect from router
```
If your router does not use the default API port, the port can be specified when connecting: 

```java 
ApiConnection con = ApiConnection.connect("10.0.1.1", 1337); // connect to router on port 1337
```

To open an encrypted (TLS) connection is as simple, assuming the default API-SSL port is used:

```java
ApiConnection con = ApiConnection.connectTLS("10.0.1.1"); // connect to router using TLS
```

### Connection timeouts

By default, the API will generate an exception if it cannot connect to the specified router. This can take place immediately (typically if the router returns a 'Connection refused' error), but can also take up to 60 seconds if the router host is firewalled or if there are other network problems. This 60 seconds is the 'default connection timeout' an can be overridded by passing the preferred timeout to the APi as last parameter in a ```connect()``` or ```connectTLS()``` call. Here is the non-TLS example:

```java
   ApiConnection con = ApiConnection.connect("10.0.1.1", ApiConnection.DEFAULT_PORT, 2000); // connect to router on the default API port and fail in 2 seconds
```

Connecting using TLS is similar:

```java
   ApiConnection con = ApiConnection.connect("10.0.1.1", ApiConnection.DEFAULT_TLS_PORT, 2000); // connect to router on the default TLS API port and fail in 2 seconds
```

Note that ```ApiConnection.DEFAULT_PORT``` and ```ApiConnection.DEFAULT_TLS_PORT``` are provided to allow users who use the default ports to safely use the overloaded timeout method.

### Notes about TLS: 

* Currently only anonymous TLS is supported, not certificates. 
* There is a compatibility problem between the current versions of RouterOS supporting API over TLS and the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) in Java 7 and earlier. TLS encryption works in Java 8 and later. For more information, feel free to contact me. 



In following examples the connection, login and disconnection code will not be repeated. 

## Reading data 

A simple example that returns a result: Print all interfaces.


```java
List<Map<String, String>> rs = con.execute("/interface/print");
for (Map<String,String> r : rs) {
  System.out.println(r);
}
```

Results are returned as a list of maps of String key/value pairs. The reason for this is that a command can return multiple results, which have multpile variables. For example, to print the names of all the interfaces returned in the command above, do:

```java
for (Map<String, String> map : rs) { 
  System.out.println(map.get("name"));
}
```

### Filtering results

The same query, but with the results filtered: Print all interfaces of type 'vlan'.

```java
List<Map<String, String>> rs = con.execute("/interface/print where type=vlan");
```

### Selecting returned fields

The same query, but we only want certain result fields names: Print all interfaces of type 'vlan' and return just their name.

```java
List<Map<String, String>> rs = con.execute("/interface/print where type=vlan return name");
```

## Writing data 

Creating, modifying and deleting configuration objects is of course possible.

### Creating an object 

This example shows how to create a new GRE interface: 

```java
con.execute("/interface/gre/add remote-address=192.168.1.1 name=gre1 keepalive=10");
```

### Modify an existing object

Change the IP address in the object created by the above example:

```java
con.execute("/interface/gre/set .id=gre1 remote-address=10.0.1.1"); 
```

### Remove an existing object

And now remove the object:

```java
con.execute("/interface/gre/remove .id=gre1"); 
```

## Asynchronous commands

We can run some commands asynchronously in order to continue receiving updates:

This example shows how to run '/interface wireless monitor' and have the result sent to a listener object, which prints it:

```java
String tag = con.execute("/interface/wireless/monitor .id=wlan1 return signal-to-noise", 
      new ResultListener() {

            public void receive(Map<String, String> result) {
                System.out.println(result);
            }

           public void error(MikrotikApiException e) {
               System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
           }

           public void completed() {
                System.out.println("Asynchronous command has finished"); 
           }
            
        }
  );
```

The above command will run and send results asynchronously as they become available, until it is canceled. The command (identified by the unique String returned) is canceled like this:

```java
con.cancel(tag);
```

From version 2.0.0 of the API the error() and completed() methods are part of the ResultListener interface. 

## Command timeouts

Command timeouts can be used to make sure that synchronous commands either return or fail within a specific time. Command timeouts are separate from the connection timeout used in ```connect()``` and ```connectTLS()```, and can be set using ```setTimeout()```. Here is an example:

```java
ApiConnection con = ApiConnection.connect("10.0.1.1"); // connect to router
con.setTimeout(5000); // set command timeout to 5 seconds
con.login("admin","password"); // log in to router
con.execute("/system/reboot"); // execute a command
``` 
It is important to note that command timeouts can be set before ```login()``` is called, and can therefore influence the behaviour of login. 

The default command timeout, if none is set by the user, is 60 seconds.
